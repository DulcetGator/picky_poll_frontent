# Picky Poll
Convenient ranked-choice voting, at [pickypoll.com](pickypoll.com)

Picky Poll is intended to be the most convenient way to perform a small- or
mid-sized ranked-choice vote. Registration is not required; inviting users to
vote in a poll is done simply by sharing a secret URL.

## Developer Quick Start
```sh
BACKEND_ENV=prod yarn start
```
If you are running a backend instance locally, you can omit the `BACKEND_ENV`
var.
